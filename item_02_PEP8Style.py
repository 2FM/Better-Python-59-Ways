#
# Whitespace: In Python, whitespace is syntactically significant. Python
# programmers are especially sensitive to the effects of whitespace on
# code clarity.

# Use spaces instead of tabs for indentation.

# Use four spaces for each level of syntactically significant indenting.

# Lines should be 79 characters in length or less.

# Continuations of long expressions onto additional lines should be indented
# by four extra spaces from their normal indentation level.

# In a file, functions and classes should be separated by two blank lines.

# In a class, methods should be separated by one blank line.

# Don't put spaces around list indexes, function calls, or keyword argument
# assignments.

# Put one-and only one-space before and after variable assignments.


# Naming: PEP 8 suggests unique styles of naming for different part in the
# language.

# Functions, variables, and attributs should be in lovercase_underscore format.

# Protected instance attributes should be in _leading_underscore format.

# Private instance attributes should be in __double_leading_underscore format.

# Classes and exceptions should be in CapitalizedWord format.

# Module-level constants should be in ALL_CAPS format.

# Instance methods in classes should use self as the name of the first
# parameter (which refers to the object).

# Class methods should use cls as the name of the first parameter (which
# refers to the class).
