# Chapter 8: Production


# Putting a Python program to use requires moving it from a development
# environment to a production environment. Supporting disparate configurations
# like this can be a challenge. Making programs that are dependable in
# multiple situations is just as important as making programs with correct
# functionality.

# The goal is to productionize your Python programs and make them bulletproof
# while they're in use. Python has built-in modules that aid in hardening your
# programs. It provides facilities for debugging, optimizing, and testing to
# maximize the quality and performance of your programs at runtime.


# Item 54: Consider module-scoped code to configure deployment environments
